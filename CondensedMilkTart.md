## Ingredients
- 1 can of Condensed Milk
- 3 cans of Milk
- 5ml Butter
- 2 Eggs
- 60ml Corn Starch
- 40ml Custard
- 5ml Vanilla Flavour
- Pinch of salt
- 2 Pack of Classic Bakers Tennis Biscuits / Coconut Biscuits

## Method
Line the bottom of a glass bowl with butter and whole Tennis Biscuits in a single layer.
Cook the can of Condensed Milk and 2.5 cans of Milk with butter in a microwave for 10 minutes.
Whisk the rest of the ingredients together with the cooked Milk mixture.
Microwave again for another 5 minutes or until it starts thickening. 
Pour the mixture over the layer of Tennis Biscuits.
Put in the fridge to set.

## Variation
Instead of simply lining the bowl with whole Tennis Biscuits crush or blend them until fine.
Add 60ml of melted butter and mix then use this mixture to create a crust by compacting it at the bottom of the bowl.
Prepare and put this crust in the fridge for at least 1 hour prior to adding the Filling prepared as above.
